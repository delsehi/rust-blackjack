# Black Jack in Rust

This is a simple implementation of the card game Black Jack that you can play in the terminal. 

It's only intended as a small personal project for learning the basics of Rust syntax. 

Feel free to fork it and add a pull request if you're learning Rust!

## Game play

The dealer shuffles the deck and hands out two cards to the player and one for themselves. 

The player can ask for more cards. If they get higher than 21, they lose. 

Then the dealer plays. They take cards until they have at least 17 points. 

If the points are equal on 17, 18 or 19, the dealer wins. Equal on 20, 21 or Blackjack no one wins.
